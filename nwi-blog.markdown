**4.27.17:**  Today, we introduce our Northern Westchester Indivisible (NWI) blog, called -  "We the People." NWI started with an email to 20 people. Our first meeting was in the living room of one of our members, during a snowstorm. 75 people showed up. We are now 270 members strong.[Join our resistance](http://nwindivisible.org/become-a-member.html).
