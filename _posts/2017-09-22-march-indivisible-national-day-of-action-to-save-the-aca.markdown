Health is one of the most important aspects of life and something that all deserve. The Trump administration is currently attempting to destroy the Affordable Healthcare Act (ACA), a law created under the Obama administration that gave healthcare to millions of people. To send a message to politicians that healthcare needs to be protected, Indivisible is doing a national march on Monday to protect the ACA.
