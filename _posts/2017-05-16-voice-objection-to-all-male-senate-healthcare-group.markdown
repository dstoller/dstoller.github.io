call-script-text: Not everyone is at the table that needs to be at the table to discuss
  health care, Sen. McConnell. 51% of the US population is female. 37% is not white.
  19% has a disability. More than 3% is LGBT. By these statistics, your committee
  should have six women, four minorities, two disabled people, and one gay person.
  A group of white, straight men could harm those excluded from the conversation.
  Please make it right.
