From INDIVISIBLE:

Yes, this is a mess the Republicans started. But now, Democrats need to fight harder than ever to clean it up.

Democrats don’t control Congress, but their votes were needed to pass Republican spending bill. On January 19, they held strong by withholding their support for another short-term funding bill until Republicans came to fix the messes that they created. But just three days later, Democrats gave in, gave away their leverage, and voted to approve a short-term funding bill without protections for Dreamers.

The next continuing resolution (CR) runs out on February 8. Making a call to your members of Congress (MoCs) is the most impactful thing you can do right now. Here’s what you can do:

Visit DreamerPledge.org to read our latest analysis. Find out if your members of Congress (MoCs) are Dream Heroes or Dream Killers.
Use our Dream Hero call script if to thank your Senators who voted to protect Dreamers. And use our Dream Killer call script if your Senator voted to fund the government without protecting Dreamers.
Make your call using our toll-free line at 1-855-980-2355. You’ll be prompted for your zip code and immediately connected to one of your Senators.
Call back again and you’ll be connected to your other Senator!
Once you’ve talked to both your Senators, make a call to your Representative using the Dream Hero or Dream Killer script.
