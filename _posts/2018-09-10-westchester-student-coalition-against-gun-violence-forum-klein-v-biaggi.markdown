On August 27th at the Pelham Art Center, the Westchester Student Coalition Against Gun Violence hosted a public forum between Jeffrey Klein and Alessandra Biaggi. The purpose of this forum was to understand the differences in addressing gun violence between the candidates. Topics discussed were youth engagement, the Safe Act, and the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC). 

There didn't seem to be much difference between Biaggi and Klein on policy, other than that Klein believed in retired police officers being security guards in school while Biaggi didn't. One main issue was Biaggi stating Klein has a history history in the IDC of not voting with democrats and preventing more liberal gun laws, while Klein said they passed the strongest legislation on gun control (the Safe Act). He also stated that, at the time, the democrats were corrupt. Biaggi countered that both parties were corrupt, as was an IDC member who went to jail, and you should stand by and try to reform your party.

Despite these disagreements, both candidates support stronger gun control. Their primary election will be held on September 13th.
