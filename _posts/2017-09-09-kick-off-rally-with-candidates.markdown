Voting to elect representatives who resist Trump is urgent. Indivisible Westchester is helping provide the opportunity for citizens to learn about what they stand for, helping them make informed decisions about how to vote. The County election kick-off rally will have local candidates available for a meet and greet! Additionally, other members of Indivisible Westchester will be there to talk with.
