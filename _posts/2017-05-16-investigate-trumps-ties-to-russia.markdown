Call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Trump’s ties to Russia. Indivisible has a brand new document explaining the situation and how you can have the most leverage.

[Check out the new backgrounder here](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/truth-or-trump/?link_id=4&can_id=2e970086a6b5ce2e764f22e9f38a873f&source=email-indivisible-leaders-demand-the-truth-on-trump&email_referrer=indivisible-leaders-demand-the-truth-on-trump&email_subject=indivisible-leaders-demand-the-truth-on-trump).

This week, not only did Trump fire FBI Director James Comey, he then went on national television and [admitted](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-reveals-he-asked-comey-whether-he-was-under-investigation-n757821?link_id=5&can_id=2e970086a6b5ce2e764f22e9f38a873f&source=email-indivisible-leaders-demand-the-truth-on-trump&email_referrer=indivisible-leaders-demand-the-truth-on-trump&email_subject=indivisible-leaders-demand-the-truth-on-trump) that the Russia investigation was part of his reason for doing so. This essentially amounts to a constitutional crisis. The American people deserve to know just how serious this administration’s ties to Russia are, but it’s clear that Republican Members of Congress aren’t in a hurry to find the answers. And we can’t trust whoever Trump nominates as the next FBI Director to take this seriously either.
It’s time to demand that a special prosecutor be appointed to continue the investigation—and your Senators should be doing all they can to ensure that this happens. Demand that your Senators [withhold consent and filibuster](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/senate-withholding-consent-filibustering/?link_id=6&can_id=2e970086a6b5ce2e764f22e9f38a873f&source=email-indivisible-leaders-demand-the-truth-on-trump&email_referrer=indivisible-leaders-demand-the-truth-on-trump&email_subject=indivisible-leaders-demand-the-truth-on-trump) all Senate business until a special prosecutor is in place.
