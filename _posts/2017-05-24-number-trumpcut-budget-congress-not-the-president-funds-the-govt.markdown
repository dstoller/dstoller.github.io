  **KEY MESSAGES FOR YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS**

  Here are the key messages that your MoCs need to be hearing from you now:

  * **No cuts to entitlements and safety net programs.** The budget proposes to slash $800B[ ](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/us/politics/trump-budget-cuts.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0)from Medicaid, $72B from Social Security benefits for the disabled, and another $464 billion from food stamps and other core programs for working families.

  * **Demand parity between defense and non-defense spending.** “Non-defense spending” is where you’ll find funding for public education, repairing roads and bridges, and protecting our environment. Since 2011, increases to defense spending have been matched with increases to non-defense spending, or cuts to non-defense with cuts to defense. The Trump Budget would violate this principle by taking $57 billion out of non-defense programs to pay for growing the already huge U.S. military budget.

  * **No funding for a border wall or ramped up internal immigration enforcement.** The budget proposes a $1.6 billion down payment on Trump’s costly wall, something that Americans don’t want, won’t work, and will only make us less safe. Make sure that Trump doesn’t get the resources he needs for this or his mass deportation force, which will not only tear American families apart, but will also make our nation less safe.

  * **Don’t weaken the future of the U.S. economy—invest in education and research, and support business innovation.** The Trump budget forecasts impossibly rosy economic growth, while simultaneously cutting out major engines of future growth. (Again, tax cuts aren’t the silver bullet Republicans want them to be.) Not only would the Trump budget result in immediate and acute harms to working families and the poor—it would erode the path to the American dream and the foundation for new innovations that will power our future economy.

  * **No new requirements for tax credits that help working families.** The budget would require a Social Security number in order to apply for the Child Tax Credit, a critical tool to help working families with children make ends meet. This would drive millions of American children into poverty.

  * **Demand “revenue-neutral” tax legislation.** This means asking that any tax cuts need to be offset by closing tax loopholes for the wealthy and corporations, which will protect funding for essential programs. Reject the magical thinking that Trump’s tax cuts will pay for themselves—they won't
