Resisting Trump requires people power, which requires volunteers. *Indivisible: Somers & North Salem* is asking for volunteers to go door-to-door to talk to people about electing Tom Newman and Bob Ondrovic, two anti-Trump candidates running for the Town Board. There will be an opportunity before canvassing to meet the candidates.
