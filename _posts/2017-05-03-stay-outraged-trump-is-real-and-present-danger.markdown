**5.3.17:** Through the efforts of many energized friends and neighbors we have been able to point out the dangers of the Trump administration.

Whether it is the tilt toward authoritarianism or the outright lying, the Trump administration stands out as a real and present danger to our democracy.

The actions that are called for include but are not limited to communal marching and outspoken rejection of the Trump programs.

We need to know about the Russian connection and why it is taking so long for Congress to do its work.
