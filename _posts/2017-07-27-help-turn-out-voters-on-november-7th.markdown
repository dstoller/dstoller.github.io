Indivisible Westchester has a campaign to send handwritten notes to Democrats and like-minded voters encouraging them to vote November 7th. Their next postcard event is this Friday, July 28 at the Voracious Reader from 11:00AM-4:00PM (1997 Palmer Avenue, Larchmont, NY).\

It's also possible to write from postcards from home, or better yet, invite your friends and have your own party. Need materials? Email IW at [iwcountyevents@gmail.com](mailto:iwcountyevents@gmail.com).
