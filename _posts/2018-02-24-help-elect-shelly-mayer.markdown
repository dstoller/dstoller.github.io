While democrats have a majority in the New York State Senate, they do not have this in practice due to the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of democrats who vote with republicans. Electing Shelley Mayer will change that and restore the democratic majority in the New York State Senate, re-uniting the democrats and enabling democrats to re-gain the political power they would be expected to have in NY, a solidly blue state.
