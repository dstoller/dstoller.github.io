Join the Indivisible State-wide day of action to stop TrumpCare. NY Indivisible groups across the state will be hosting sit-ins to demand Senator Schumer does more: (1) Resist through procedure by withholding consent and (2) Filibuster by amendment until full and transparent hearings are held on the Senate Healthcare Bill.
