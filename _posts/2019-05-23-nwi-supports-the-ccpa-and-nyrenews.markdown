*[The Climate and Community Protection Act (CCPA)](http://www.nyrenews.org/what-we-do), described by Heather McGhee and Robert Reich in The Nation as “the most progressive climate-equity policy we’ve seen,” sets a path to the highest standard nationwide for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions – 100% of human-caused climate pollution eliminated by 2050 from all sectors.*

We must focus on climate change at the state level...as nothing is happening at the federal level...especially with a denier in the white house.

*The CCPA bill not only mandates an economy-wide shift to renewable energy, but also defines equity provisions which prioritize existing and future resources towards vulnerable, impacted, historically disadvantaged and front line communities, and establishes specific supports for workers.*
