### Our Knock Every Door event was such a success we are doin**g it again!**

**What:** Target registered democrat and independent voters to raise awareness about Rob Astorino, the county executive race, and elections this fall.

**When:** Weekends in June- 6/2-6/16.

**Why:** Because our mission is to increase voter turnout in local elections and **#TakeBackWestchester**

**How:** By talking to like minded neighbors about our concerns. Studies show personal interactions are the best way to persuade others to take action.
