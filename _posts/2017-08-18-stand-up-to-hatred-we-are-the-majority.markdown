"Although in power, hate is not the majority."

Bigotry, such as was seen in the horrible tragedy of Charlottesville, is wrong of all stripes and needs to be stopped.

Stand up to bigotry by plugging in your zip code to the link above and learning about activist events in your area. Tomorrow, August 19th, there is an event in NYC called, "Confronting White Supremacy from Charlottesville to the White House" at the SW corner of Chambers & Centre Sts (the corner of City Hall Park). The rally is from 11:00am to 12:30pm.

This organization seeks to stand up against prejudice towards others and to prevent the stripping away of rights from people based on their identity. They believe that this is possible by bringing people of this goal together to raise awareness.
