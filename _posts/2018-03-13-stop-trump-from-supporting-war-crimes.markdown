  Caller: Hi, I’m a constituent calling from [part of state]. I’m calling about the joint resolution introduced by Senators Lee and Sanders to end our unauthorized war in Yemen. It is essential for Senator [name] to support this resolution when it comes to the floor for a vote.

  Staffer: Thank you for calling. The senator is still reviewing the language and I will relay your concerns.

  Caller: Please do—Congress has never authorized this war, and evidence shows that the airstrikes the U.S. is supporting are causing a humanitarian crisis and may amount to war crimes. The chaos has allowed terror groups such as ISIS and Al Qaeda affiliates to gain more power and land. It’s time for Senator [name] to exercise Congress’ constitutional power and end this unauthorized war.

  Caller: I’ll be sure to share that with the boss.

  Staffer: Thank you—I’ll be closely monitoring the senator’s vote.

The war in Yemen is very brutal, with in-discriminant bombings of the country that have killed many thousands of innocent people. The US, unfortunately, continues to support Saudi Arabia's air strikes on Yemen and support a blockade that prevents basic resources from being obtained by Yemenis, leading to disease and starvation. Despite being a participant in this war, the US has never actually voted on whether or not to go to war in Yemen. This vote is now happening. Please urge Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer to vote AGAINST the war in Yemen.
