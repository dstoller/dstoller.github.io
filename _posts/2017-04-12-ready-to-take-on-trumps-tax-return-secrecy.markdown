Call our MoCs and make sure they support the **Presidential Tax Transparency Act **& that they don't support Trump's tax plan.

* ***Trump’s Tax Plan. On **4/26, Trump announced a tax plan. It’s short on details but long on giveaways for the rich (including Trump himself). Congress does not have to follow Trump’s lead on this, and with your pressure they won’t—use our [updated tax reform explainer](http://twitter.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=6e44580c77d04c66ad74296e8&id=5d4c5fd24b&e=ad5c7fe4c2) to ground Trump’s tax giveaway plan before it can take off.*

* *And remember, Trump should not weigh in on our taxes until we can see his: remind your House Representative to support a [discharge petition](http://twitter.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=6e44580c77d04c66ad74296e8&id=7add0ca4ea&e=ad5c7fe4c2) for the [Presidential Tax Transparency Act (H.R. 305)](http://twitter.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=6e44580c77d04c66ad74296e8&id=fc7ead2c32&e=ad5c7fe4c2).*
