Voting is about making change! Our current County Executive, a Trump defender named Robert Astorino, is being challenged by George Latimer and Ken Jenkins, two anti-Trump candidates. By determining who gains office, the ballot box is the most effective way of resisting Trump. Voting is on September 12th.
