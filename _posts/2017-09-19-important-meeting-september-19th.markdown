To truly resist the Trump agenda, being engaged in local politics is paramount. NWI's next meeting, scheduled for September 19th at 7:00pm, is based off of this reasoning and that goal. Please attend to meet with local candidates and work on activist events in the near future.

Activities:
1) Meeting with candidates in upcoming elections, including Kitley Covill for Westchester County Legislator, Judge Christi Acker for NYS Supreme Court, and other candidates for Town Boards involved with NWI.
2) Discuss "Commit to Vote" event scheduled for October 15th. More volunteers and funding are necessary. 
3) Learn about Get Out The Vote coordination efforts with activist groups across Northern Westchester.
