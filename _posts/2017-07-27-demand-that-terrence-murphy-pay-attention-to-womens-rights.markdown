Many NWI members live in North Salem, Pound Ridge, Somers or the town/village of Mount Kisco. Their NY State Senator is Terrence Murphy (District 40).

Senator Murphy does not support [The Reproductive Health Act](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/s2796/amendment/original) (RHA, Senate Bill S2796) which is still in committee. 

Please read this forceful open letter (link below) written by Elise-Ann Konstantin (CD-17) to Senator Murphy.  Feel free to post/distribute/share, print/fax it to the Senator with your own comments, whatever you wish.
