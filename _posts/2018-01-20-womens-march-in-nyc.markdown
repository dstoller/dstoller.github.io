Indivisible Westchester is meeting at 10am @ West 79th and Columbus Ave (NE corner).
NWI, Action Together, Voices Rising and Up2US will head into NYC together via train.
9:01am from Katonah, 9:08am from Mt. Kisco

Message from the women's march:
NYPD will allow marchers to begin lining up along Central Park West at 10:00AM. The rally will start at 11:30AM. The march will start directly after the rally (between 12:30-1:00).
Please be aware, for your safety, NYPD will be doing soft checks, similar to what a national museum would do. Bags are highly discouraged but allowed. Strollers and service animals are allowed. Due to funding, portable restrooms will NOT be provided.
