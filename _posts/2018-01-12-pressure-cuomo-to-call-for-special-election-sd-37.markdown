call-script-text: I'm calling to demand that Governor Cuomo call for a special election
  immediately to fill the vacant senate seat in the 37th district. His continuing
  refusal to do so indicates his desire to enable the Party of Trump in the NY State
  Senate. Unless Governor Cuomo shows that he's truly committed to enabling a TRULY
  Democratic majority, he will lose my support.

To oppose Trumpish policies, it is necessary to have a majority in the NY State Senate. Given that George Latimer was elected County Executive, his seat in the NY State Senate now needs to be filled with a progressive democrat. Please pressure Cuomo to call for a special election and then help get Shelley Mayer elected!

Call Cuomo: 518-474-8390, press #2 for live person.
