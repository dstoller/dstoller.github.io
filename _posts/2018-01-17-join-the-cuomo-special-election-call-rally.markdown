call-script-text: â€œHi, my name is [insert your name] and I live in New York. I'm calling
  to demand that Governor Cuomo immediately call for special elections to fill the
  2 vacant Senate seats and 9 Assembly seats. These nearly 1.8 MILLION constituents
  deserve representation! If this is not done in time for newly elected legislators
  to participate in this year's budget talks, we will hold the Governor personally
  responsible for enabling Trump's agenda in NYS this year. "

Governor Cuomo has still not called for a special election to fill up the NY state legislature, and as long as he doesn't, people from those districts will lack a voice. Indivisible Westchester is sponsoring Thursday's call rally to encourage Governor Cuomo to call for these special elections.

From Indivisible Westchester:
This Tuesday through Friday, activists from around the greater NYC area are participating in call rally to demand that Governor Cuomo call a special election immediately to fill 11 empty seats in the legislature so that people in those districts are represented during the budget process.  The election must be called by the end of this week or else it will be too late for those districts to have any say about the budget. One of the districts that is currently unrepresented is Senate District 37, which is the seat that was vacated by George Latimer when he was sworn in as County Executive at the first of the year.
