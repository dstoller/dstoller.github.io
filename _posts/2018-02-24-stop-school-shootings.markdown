School shootings have, unfortunately, become all to common. Little is being done to fix this problem due to the power of the gun lobby. Due to the corrupt campaign finance system, the NRA gives massive amounts of money to many politicians, resulting in those politicians refusing to regulate assault weapons. However, the NRA can be beaten if Americans turn up at the polls and elect politicians who are not influenced by the NRA.

"But the gun lobbyâ€™s stranglehold on our elected officials does not need to continue, if candidates stand up to the lobby and voters demand that they commit themselves to the sorts of changes that a vast majority of Americans want.

With midterm elections coming up this fall, America has a chance to get that message across. Candidates must realize that reducing gun violence is a winning and moral issue. Aggressive turnout by voters who believe this can defeat the N.R.A. at the polls. Until then, the bloodshed will continue."
