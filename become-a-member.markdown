Members of our Northern Westchester Indivisible (NWI) are defined by our action and find solidarity in our shared opposition to Trump and Trumpism. Each of us explicitly reserves our individual stances on specific issues for other forums as we believe resisting Trump is more important than any single issue. We adhere to a Code of Conduct that welcomes and respects everybody.

Members of NWI come from all kinds of backgrounds and political persuasions. Some of us are first-time activists and others have been at this for decades. We are citizens and noncitizens. Most importantly, we are all patriots that want the best for our country and are willing to work for it.

The basic mission of NWI is to form a coalition in the NY 18th Congressional District that resists the Trump agenda by actively influencing our members of Congress and local individuals and groups who support that agenda.

**All are welcome.**
