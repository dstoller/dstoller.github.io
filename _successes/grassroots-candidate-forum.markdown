NWI co-hosted a successful local candidates forum in September 2019 with our local activist partners - Action Together Northern Westchester, Voices Rising, Yorktown Indivisible and Up2Us. We had an interactive discussion with the community and an engaged group of candidates representing Bedford, Lewisboro, Mt. Kisco, New Castle, North Salem, Pound Ridge, Somers and Yorktown.
